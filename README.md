## Tech Stack for the Front End

Our technology stack was carefully chosen to provide a robust and efficient development environment:

1. **React with Typescript:** We utilized React with Typescript as our front-end framework, leveraging its flexibility and component-based architecture to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.

2. **Sass and Sass Modules:** To enhance CSS development, we integrated Sass and Sass modules into our workflow, allowing for efficient and modular styling.

3. **Material UI:** we used this CSS library to facilitate CSS development, by using its user friendly components.

4. **Vite:** We optimized our development experience using Vite, a next-generation front-end tooling system that provides fast and optimized builds, ensuring a smooth development experience.
